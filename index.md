## Motivation: Anxiety and Depression

<!---
My research so far has been motivated by the goal of working to improve the MH of teens in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
[maybe don't say this: MH is a significant public health problem, but I don't think it's received the attention comensurate with its magnitude.]  

This graph is from a US nationally representative survay of adolescent mental health, the national comorbidity survey adolescent supplement--which is actually the dataset that I used for this dissertation. 
IT shows the cumulative prevelance of different categories of disorders by age. 
For this talk, I'm going to be focusing on adolescent depression (which comprises most of what's shown in green) and anxiety (which is shown in red)
This nationally representative survey found that nearly 12% of adolescents had ever had major depressive disorder and nearly 32% ever had an  anxiety disorder....

## Motivation: Anxiety and Depression

<!---
These disorders are not typically isolated, time-limited events, but can have consequence that extend over the lifecourse
For example, they cause children and adolescents to Miss school and sociodevelopmental opportunities $\rightarrow$ which studies have shown negatively affects educational achievement (Breslau et al., 2008), 
future employment (Kessler et al., 2006), 
earnings (Kessler et al., 2008),

## Motivation: Importance of Place

<!---
So, it's clear that MH is imporatnat, but why neighborhood? 
well, intuitively, we understand that living in a neighborhood in east bmore may be a different experience than living in a neihgborhood in roland park. 
For example, i taught creative writing to a class of public HS students in DC for a year. theyhad to deal wiht violence on a fairly regular basi-- one of their classmates was tragically even shot and killed. its hard to imagine a classroom of kids from one of the surrounding wealthy suburbs having a similar experience. 

so living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is thought to entail exposure to more sources stress--e.g., violence, lack of opportunity for work and for education, low-collective efficacy--that act to dysregulate the stress response system within individuals. 

dysregulation of the stress response system has been linked to depression and anxiety disorders

## Motivation: Research Gaps

<!---
There has been a lot of research into the relationship between neighborhood factors like disdavatnage and mental disorders--- in the past 10 years in particular--but results have been inocnsistent. 
I think some of these inconsistencies could be due to methodologic limitations that threaten inference

read first bullet

positivity violations, which means that for a particular set of covariate values, assignment of neighborhood is deterministic--there is no randonmess. I'll get into this more later, but one example of where this can come about in neihgborhood research is due to the economic and racial segregation of neihgborhoods in this country. For example, a middle-aged white male who is at the upper end of the wealth scale may have essentially a zero probability of living in a very poor urban neihgbohoord. Similarly, a middle-aged black male who is at the lower end of the wealth scale may essentially have a zero probability of living in a very wealthy suburban, white neighbohrood. 

non-transportability, which is also called lack of generalizability. means that results estimated in some study samples may not be valid for other samples or target populations. 
neighborhood studies are typically conducted in a specific geographic area or several geographic areas. they are usually not population-based, represntative samples. as such, their findings may not  be applicable to a population of interest. 

In this dissertation, we addressed each of these--as least in part
-->

* Inconsistent results in the literature
  * Confounding (neighborhood assignment not random)
  * Positivity violations (economic and racial segregation of neighborhoods)
  * Non-transportability (neighborhood studies are typically conducted among a particular sub-population)

## Dissertation Overview

<img src="./Slide3.png" width="800" height="580">
<!---
Here is the simplified dag from earlier. 
In aim 1, we looked at the relationship between ND and prevalent D and A and assessed the extent to which level of urbanicity may modify this effect.
-->

## Dissertation Overview

<img src="./Slide4.png" width="800" height="580">
<!---
If there is a relationship between ND and D and A, it's been hypothesized to operate through dysregulation of the stress response system. 
So in Aim 2 we move slightly upstream and estimated the assocation between ND and 1 component of the stress response syste, salivary cortisol levels
-->

---

## Dissertation Overview

<img src="./Slide5.png" width="800" height="580">
<!---
In aim 3, we address a problem from Aim 2--that is that we were only able to estimate the association between ND and cortisol among the subsample of participatns for whom we had cortisl data for. 

however, what we really care about is getting an idea for what the association may be in the US population of adolescents. 
we evaluate a few ways to do this in Aim 3
-->

---

## NCS-A
<!---
For this dissertation, we use data from the NCSA.
read first bullet
The NCS-A collects information from a variety of sources, but i'll just go through the sources that are relevant to this disseration
read through
CIDI = Composite international diagnostic interview, corresponds to DSM-IV and ICD-9 diagnoses.
saliva was collected before and after each interview for the cortisol samples. 
-->
* Nationally representative, cross-sectional sample of U.S. adolescents 13-17 years old (N=10,123)
* Sources of information relevant to this dissertation:
  * Face-to-face, computer-assisted interviews with the adolescent. 
    * CIDI modified for adolescents.
  * Saliva collected before and after each interview.
  * Self-administered questionnaire to parents or parent surrogate of the adolescent.
  * Geocoded residence.

## Aim 1

<img src="./Slide6.png" width="800" height="580">
<!---
Again, in Aim 1 we examined the pieces that are highlighted in red. 
We looked at the association between ND and prevalent D and A and assessed possibile effect modification by urbanicity. 
-->

---

## Aim 1: Background

### Gaps
* Inconsistent results 
* Hypothesis: effect modification by urbanicity may contribute to inconsistent results.

<!---
This aim was motivated by the 
Inconsistent results I found when reviewing the literature on the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage-adolescent D and A. 
* I noticed that Studies reporting an association between neighborhood disadvantage and depression/anxiety tended to sample from urban populations whereas studies reporting no association tended to sample from non-urban populations or a mix.
This may be because living in a disadvantaged neighborhood in an urban area entails exposure to a diffrent set of stressors than living in a disadvantaged neighborhood in a rural area.
for example, Lack of green space, noise, residential instability and exposure to violence are more prevalent in urban areas. and there is some evidence that these stressors are linked to emotional disorders 
* so our hypothesis was that urbanicity may be an effect modifier. specifically, that The association between neighborhood disadvantage and adolescent depression/anxiety may be greater in urban versus non-urban neighborhoods.
-->

---

## Aim 1: Background
### Study  
* NCS-A well-suited to evaluate this question. 
  * Nationally representative survey of U.S. adolescent mental health (DSM-IV)
  * Geocoded residences, samples include mix of urban, suburban, and rural.  
  <br/>

<!---
I thought that the NCSA was particularly well-suited to evaluate this question. 
Because of the sampling scheme, it draws adolescents from neighborhoods across a range of urbanicities. 
In addition, addresses are geocoded to CTs, so we can obtain contextual information from Census data.

The definition of mental disorders is partciularly strong, because the instrument that was used--the CIDI--maps on to DSM-IV diagnoses.

## Aim 1: Analysis

<!---
Here is an outline of our analysis approach. 
* We had some mising data adoue to participants skipping some question. To address this, we used Multiple imputation by chained equations.
* We then performed Propensity score subclassification on these imputed datasets, excluding individuals without similar counterparts (4.7%). That's what I'm showing in the figure on the right. These are the two propensity score distributions. the red is the aadolecents in Non-dis neighborhoods the blue is kids is dis neighborhoods. 
And the PS is the predicted probability of living in a disadvantaged neihgborhood given the observed covariates. 
by excluding those without similar counterparts, we are essentially chopping off the tails. s
such that for a given propensity score, there are participants in both categories of neihgborhood. meaning that for a given propensity socre, there is some randomness in neighborhood assingment.
[change picture]
 * PS subclassification also addresses Addresses confounding stemming from non-random assignment of neighborhood residence. I'm showing a one-dimensional summary of how well this worked on teh right. blue dots are pre-subclass.red dots are post-subclas.all of our potential confounding variables are on the y axis and the standaridized mean difference is on the x axis. 
 so this is showing how balanced the two neighborhood groups are for each of the confounding variables. We can see by the blue dots that before PS subclassification, many of the variables were imbalanced. Afterwards, though, the red dots show us that the subclassification was successful in balancing these variables. 
* Within each of the PS subclasses, for each imputed dataset, we then conducted Survey design-based, weighted analysis to maintain the national representativeness of the sample.

here are our results from Aim 1.

x axis estimates this log OR for each the 3 urbanicities: non-urban, urban fringe and urban center.

see a dose response relationship where the log OR increases by level of urbanicity.
for adolescents in urban centers, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with have 59% (1.25, 2.03) greater odds of having a prevalent emotional disorder as compared to living in a non-disadvantaged neighborhood
the interaction between urban center and neighborhood dis is also significant. 
Specifically, the association between neighborhood disadvantage and emotional disorder is more than twice as large (ratio of odds ratios: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.55) for adolescents living in urban centers versus non-urban areas

slow down
As a reminder, in Aim 2 we examined the components of our conceptual model that are highlighed in red. We moved upsteam and estimated the association between ND and one aspect of the stress response system: salivary cortisol. 
-->

---

## Aim 2: Background

### Gaps
* Few studies
* Small sample size
* Racial/ethnic homogeneity
* Geographic homogeneity

<!---
In Examining the association between ND and cortisol, we were motivated by several gaps in the literature. 
* First, there has been surprisingly little research into this realtionship in adolescets. In fact, in my literature review, I only found 3 studies. (Brenner et al., 2013; Chen and Paterson, 2006; Hackman et al., 2012). [maybe don't say this part: These studies Found preliminary evidence that ND was associated with higher resting cortisol, greater reactivity.]
* However, each of thes 3 studies were Limited by small sample size and racial/ethnic and geographic homogeneity.
for example the biggest study only included 163 teens (163, 100, 79)
2/3 studiies were only of african americans
and all 3 of the studies only sampled from single urban areas (flint, St Louis, Philadelphia)
-->

## Aim 2: Background

<!---
* Again, I thought the NCS-A was well-suited to address these gaps.

### Study

* Largest sample to date (2,490 have cortisol measurements).
* Racially and ethnically diverse. 
* Participants drawn from different regions of the U.S., urbanicities.

## Aim 2: Background

*** left
<!---
Before I get into the specifics of our analysis, I want to convey that the stress response system is extremely complex, and so Examining the relationship between neighborhood sources of stress and cortisol involves requires stratgies to manage this complexity. 
First, there are numerous systems involved in stress response. cortisol is a component of one of these systems called the hypothalmic pituitary adrenal axis. 
The relationship  between ND and cortisol likely depends on the dimension of the HPA axis being measured. the two main dimensions being (1) resting, unprovoked levels and (2) and reactivity to an acute stressor
* Seoncd, the relationship between ND and cortisol also likely depense on the History of exposure to stress. 
  * Those who have been exposed to the most stress---children who are abused---have cortisol levels that look more similar to unstressed children.
  * Reactivity tends to increase with some stress, but becomes blunted with a lot of stress, like abuse
This is usually referred to as blunting because the idea is that after repeated or prolonged activation of the stress response system, this response wears out. 
-Third, the relationship may also depend on time of day. In the graph on the right, I'm showing a graph of cortisol levels shortly after wake-up.
Cortisol has an initial spike when we first wake up. called the cortisol awakening response. see graph. after this initiatl spike, declines for the rest of the day. 
and the relationship between enighborhood sources of stress may differ depending on time of day. 
graph compares cortisol levels on the y axis over time on the axis between tertiles of neighborhood violence
see that in high-violence neighborhoods cortisol levels are lower during CAR but higher during the post-CAR decline

## Aim 2: Analysis

<!---
given this complexity, cortisol is ideally measured under very strict laboratory protocols, but this isn't practical in a large, nationally representative sample like the NCSA
In the NCSA, cortisol was measured in the adolescents home right before the start of the interview and right after. 
we were left with the challenge: How to construct a controlled analysis?

Challenge: * Some kids not at-risk for a cortisol response; cortisol levels may be artificially influenced for example by medications, tobacco or other drugs 
Approach: * Restrictive exclusion criteria: exluding adolescents who were pregnant or taking oral contraceptives, diabetic, possibly using steroid inhaler, psychiatric medication, current smokers or drug users. 

Challenge: * Another challennge, as we talked about in the previous slide, is that Some kids with a history of severe or persistent adversity may experience blunting. This would have a washout effect on the association betweeh ND and cortisol 
Approach: * Sensitivity analysis excluding those with severe adversity

challenge: * Relationship may differ depending on CAR versus post-CAR, as we saw in the picutre on the previous slide
Approach:* Cortisol measured after CAR

challenge: * Cortisol exhibits a strong diurnal rhythm, but measures taken at all times of day
Approach: * Propensity score matching with replacement   * Mahalanobis matching within propensity score calipers, which is a way of providing particularly tight control for this variable. 

challenge: * Cortisol is also affected by weekend/weekday and race/ethnicity, but samples were taken on both weekend and weekdays and among a ractially diverse sampel 
Approach: * Propensity score matching with replacement   * Exact matching on weekend/weekday
  * Exact matching on race/ethnicity
(Just in case: severe adversity defined as adolescents who reported phsyical abuse by their parent (being beaten up, choked, kicked, punched, burned, bitten threatened with a gun or reported 3 or more of the following: parent suicide attempt or completion, parent alcohol abuse, parent drug abuse, parent arrest or imprisonment)
-->

Challenge | Approach
--------- | --------
Not at-risk for a cortisol response | Restrictive exclusion criteria
Blunting | Sensitivity analysis
Heterogeneity by CAR/ post-CAR | Restricted to post-CAR
Diurnal rhythm | PS with Mahalanobis matching 
Other strong predictors | PS with exact matching

## Aim 2: Analysis
<!---
Here again is an outline of our analysis approach. 
* As in Aim 1, we had some mising data adoue to participants skipping some question. To address this, we used Multiple imputation by chained equations.
* We then performed PS matching with replacement and Mahalanobis matching within calipers and exact matching as described on the previous slide. 
The picture on the right again shows the balance between the neighborhood groups aon a list of potential confounding variables before matching in blue and after matching in red. We see that the PS matching succeeded in balancing the two groups across these confounders. 
*Then, we performed regression outcome analyses on the [read]
This approach can be thought of as being double robust, because the potential confounders are included in both the PS model and outcome model. so if one model is incorrectly specified but the other is correctly specified, we should still get a consistent estimate

## Aim 2: Results
<!---
Top portion, showing conditional expected ratios of cortisol levels comparing adolescents in disadvantaged neighborhoods to those in non-disadvatnaged neighborhoods. Point estimates and 95% CI
Top panel is for the pre-interview cortisol levels and Middle Panel is for the post-interview cortisol levels.
Bottom shows the conditional expected diffrences in cortisol slope during the late decline period comparing adolescents living in disadvantaged versus non-disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Again, we show the estimate and 95% CI
In each of the three panels, we show the results for the unadjusted and 3 adjusted models. 
All adjusted models used adjusted for possible confounders listed in the previous figure in both propesntiy score matching and regression. BEcause of the definition of confounder, these were variables that we thought would be affected by the exposure. So for example, gender, age, race, season, region of the country, immigrant status, etc. 
Adjusted model 2 added variables for which there could be debate about whether they could be affected by the exposure. So, they could be confounders and mediators. These were family income and employment history and current status.
Adjusted model 3 added hypothesized mediators: small for gestational age, BMI, and sleep variables like typical bedtime on weekdays, bedtime on weekends, typical hours slept on weeknights and typical hours slept on weekends. 
So in all the models, we see that adolescents in disadvantaged neighborhoods have slightly higher cortisol levels prior to the interview than those in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
We see that there's no real difference in post-interview levels. 
Adolescents in disadvantaged neighbrohoods have slighly steeper cortisol rates of decline over the course of the interview than those in non-disadvantaged nieghborhodos. 
We interpreted these results as possibly reflecting heightened reactivity to and recovery from the novel stimulus of the interview. 
It's imporant to reiterate that we were not measuring HPA axis dimensions, so we can't make conclusions baout these.
Instead, the pre-interview levels likely reflect any activity the adolescent was engaged in prior to the interview as well as anticipation of the new situation of being interviewred in her home by a researcher for ta survey on mental health. Something out of the ordinary!
The interview was specifically designed not to be stressful, so adoelscents probably became pretty bored over the course of the interview. The post-interview levels may relfect that as well as the fact that now the adolescent has been sitting down for 2 and a half hours. 
Our findings and interpretation agree with previous human and animal aresearch. 
For examples, rats stressed when young have heighted less controlled responses to novel situations. 
young children under some stress have hghier cortisol levels there 1st day of kindergargen
congruent with one of the snmall studies on ND and coritosl in adolsecents that found that those in ND have greater reactivity to a stress test than those in non-dis neighbohroods

## Aim 3: Background
Problem raised in Aim 2:

Problem raised in Aim 2: 
* Want to estimate the association between living in a disadvantaged neighborhood and cortisol slope in a nationally representative sample, but only have cortisol data on a sub-sample. 
* Estimated associations may be different from those estimated in the complete sample if there is:
  1. effect heterogeneity and 
  2. sub-sample selection probabilities depend on effect modifiers

Broadly, problem of generalizing results from a non-randomized study sample to a specified target population.

## Aim 3: Analysis
<!---
Aim 3 consisted of a simulation study, which we then applied to our motivating example from Aim 2.
Our goal was to estimate a population average treatment effect, $E(Y_1 - Y_0)$, from survey sub-sample. 
In terms of our motivating example: this would be to estimate the average effect of living in a disdavantaged neighborhood on cortisol slope for U.S. adolescents. 

When I initially came across this issue, I thought I'd just use inverse probability weights. However, in this scenario, that approach would involve multiplying 3 weights--(1) survey weights, (2) inverse probability of selection in the sub-sample weights, and (3) inverse probability of treatment weights. IPW already have efficiency concerns, and we were worried that they might get unweildy. So we wanted to compare IPW to some other options that might perform as well or better but would be similarly simple to implement. 

  * we Compared 3 estimators.  IPW, DRWLS, TMLE (both DRWLS and TMLE are both DR estimators)
DRWLS and TMLE have been compared with IPW previously, but typically in the scenario where there is one source of non-randomness (for example, nonrandom treatment assignment or non-random sample selection or missing data). We wanted to specifically look at the relative performace in this scenario where there is (1) nonrandom subsample selection from a (2) survey with weights, (3) non-random treatment assignment and (4) effect heterogeneity. In doing this, we also demonstrated how to impelment TMLE in the context of survey weights.

## Aim 3: Analysis
### Simulation study

<img src="./simulationsetupfig.png" width="800" height="400">

<!---
This figure depicts the setup of our simulation. We start with a population of 100,000 individuals, there is a selection mechanism that selects 10,000 of these into a survey--similar to the NCSA. 
There is then another selection mechanism that selects 5,000 of the survey participants into the subsample. kind of like in the NCSA data where a few thousand of the NCSA participants had cortisol data measured. 
The nice part about using simulation, is that we can see the full data for everyone in the population. so we see everyone's vector of covariates, W, treatment assignment, A, and potential outcomes Y under treatment A=1 and no treatment A=0. 
So, we know the true PATE in this simulation. 

In the observed data, however, we observe no data for individuals not in the survey. 
For those in the survey but not in the subsample, we see their covariates and treatment.
For those in teh subsample, we see covariates, treatment and the potential outcome for the treatment they actually received. 
-->

## Aim 3: Results
<!---
In this simulation, we considered two different scenarios. Scenario 1 had linear EH and is shown on the left. Scenario 2 had non-linear EH. and is shown on the right.
what we're showing on the x-axis are the PATE estimates over the 1,000 simulations when we correctly specified the all parametric models. 
there is a red line at the true value, which is 3 in both scenarios
The estimators are on the y axis. Show the importance of adjusting for all 3 sources of non-randomness: 
selection into survey, selection into subsample, non-random treatment assignment.
Top estimators adjust for 0, 1, or 2 of the soures. Bottom 3 estimators adjust for all 3.
Naive method, we do't adjust for anything .we just subtract the average outcome value for those without the treatment from the average outcome value for those with the treatment.
below that, IPSW shows how the estimate improves when we adjust for selection into the survey sample
below that, IPTW adjusts for non-random treatment assignment
IPTSvy W adjusts for nonrandom treatment assignment and selection into the survey, but does not account for nonrandom selection into the sub-sample. 
IPW, DRWLS and TMLE all  acoun for nonrandom treatment and both selection mechanisms
We see that each of these methods provides a consistent estimate and it turns out that both DRWLS and TMLE perform better than IPW in terms of % bias, Var, 95% CI Coverage and MSE.

## Aim 3: Results
<!---
This table summaries the meat of our results. as i showed before, we evaluated each estimator under the two different scenarios. 
we did this when when correctly specified the parametric models as i showed before, but also under various misspecifications. 
"Mod" stands for moderate misspecification where we have all teh correct variables, but the incorect form
"Maj" stands fo major misspeicifiacation where we are missing a variable. 
We misspecify each of the treatment, selection, and outcome models. 
We see that in general both DRWLS and TMLE perform well when any one of the models is misspecified.
This is not all that surprising, given that these two methods are double  robust, but what was surprising to me was the poorer performance of IPW even when all the models were correctly specificied.
This has been discussed before, but IPW continues to be widely used--I think possibly because it is easy to implement in any software. By showing how TMLE can be implemented wiht survey weights and by providing a tutorial for both TMLE and DRWLS, we hope that these better-performing methods may gain popularity.

## Dissertation Conclusions
<!---
I'd like to wrap up with some overall conclusions from this work
In this dissertation, we find further support...[read]
* Further support for the link between neighborhood and mental health. 
  * Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood associated with $\uparrow$ odds of depression/anxiety if that neighborhood is in an urban center but not otherwise.
  * Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood associated with cortisol levels. In sub-sample and for U.S. adolescents.
  
We also evaluate methods to estimate effects/ associations [read]
specifically, we recommend two DR methods as opposed to IPW. These methods are similar to IPW in terms of their straightforward implementation, but because they are double robust, they perform much better than IPW under incorrect specification of one of the treatment or selection models.

<!---
Before ending, I'd like to review a few of the dissertation's limiations and strengths.
For example, there are a number of limitations that stem from using neighborhood disadvantage as the exposure of interest
first, ND is measured with error 
this is because
1. this is a latent variable and we are using a summary measure as a proxy
2. CTs are not neighborhoods
[(maybe don't say this)
3. cut-point of disadvantage v not (Addressed in sensitivity analyses)
4. measurement may be differential by urbanicity (addressed in sensitivity analyses)]

second, there's the theoretical limiation that
1. neighborhood disadvantage does not mean the same thing for everyone. 
for one adolescent, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood may mean being exposed to multiple sources of neighborhood violence witnessing and victimization, loud noise from traffc, and interacting with neighbors and schoolmates who are relatively homogenous in their socioeconomic makeup. For another adolescent, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood may mean being exposed to violence witness- ing, but not victimization, minimal noise, and interacting with schoolmates who have a relatively diverse socioeconomic makeup. In our analyses, both of these adolescents would be classified as living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. [maybe don't say this: This is a violation of the causal inference assumption, SUTVA, which assumes only one version of each treat- ment/exposure.]
I think this is fairly significant limitation, and In future work, I would like to focus on studies with well-defined and potentially modifiable treatments/exposures. 
would aid inference as well as the study’s practical utility informing policies and programs. 
[may be don't say this either: 2. ND PS model assumes that variables in teh model are measured without error. 
examining this assumption--the effects of estimating PS when vars measured with error and strategies to relax this assumption will be area of postdoctoral work]

Cortisol as outcome
Measurement limitations
cortisol is sensitivite to a wide range of factors that are typically held constant in when cortisol is measured under laboratory conditions, but were not able to be held constant in its collection in this case. 
the study did not use protocols that correspond to one of the HPA axis domains. administer either a standardized acute stressor (e.g., a Trier stress test) or rest period are required. we cannot infer that the cortisol outcomes in Aim 2 map onto specific HPA axis dimensions.

cortisol is only one of many biomarkers of one of many systems involved in stress response. So, we are only observing one tiny piece of this very complex system.

## Strengths

<!---
* Sample: large, racial/ethnically and geographically diverse, nationally representative of U.S. adolescents
  * Ability to answer questions about effect modification that previously could not be answered
  * Address generalizability
* Address issues that pose particular challenges in neighborhood studies: 
  * Confounding due to non-random neighborhood assignment: PS methods, sensitivity analyses for an unobserved confounder
  * Structural positivity violations due to economic and racial segregation: PS methods, limiting to comparable sub-sample
* Facilitate use of DR methods over IPW for simultaneously addressing non-random treatment assignment and non-random sample selection. Demonstrate TMLE implementation in the case of survey weights.

## Acknowledgements

<!---
I am deeply appreciative of the support, encouragement, and guidance of others in completing this dissertation. In particular, I would like to thank my advisors, Drs. Tom Glass and Liz Stuart. Tom provided me with encouragement to tackle the issues that inspired me from the beginning of the Ph.D. program. His careful think- ing and embracing of complexity modeled patience and thoroughness in approaching research questions. Liz provided me with innumerable hours of advice in applying causal inference methods. She pushed me further than I would have pushed myself in applying more advanced methods and becoming a better programmer (and frequent cluster user). In the process, I discovered that this meld of causal inference and social epidemiology was the research area that most excited me.
I would also like to thank my committee members, Drs. Rosa Crum and Gary Wand, as well as Drs. Kathleen Merikangas, Bill Eaton, Michael Rosenblum, and Iva ́n D ́ıaz for their many conversations and guidance over the years and iterations of this dissertation. They have deepened my understanding of both substantive and methodological issues within this dissertation and helped place these issues within the broader literature. This dissertation is truly a collaborative e↵ort with all of them.
I’ve been fortunate during my time in the Ph.D. program to be the recipient of several generous funding mechanisms, including an NIMH pre-doctoral training fellowship and Sommer scholarship. These have allowed me to dedicate more attention and time to research and less to worrying about paying the bills. Finally, I would like to thank my husband, William, for his support, grocery shopping, and whistling; my parents, Lisa and Kurt Rudolph, and brother Scott Rudolph, for their encouragement; and many friends for their enthusiasm.
